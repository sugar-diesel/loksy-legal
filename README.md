# loksy-legal

This repository hosts the legal documents for the **Loksy** app. It exists to satisfy App Store review requirements and to provide transparent, public, HTTPS-accessible policies.

## Documents

- **Privacy Policy**  
  File: [`privacy-policy.md`](./privacy-policy.md)  
  (Optional GitHub Pages URL if enabled: `https://sugar-diesel.github.io/loksy-legal/privacy-policy`)

- **Terms & Conditions**  
  File: [`terms.md`](./terms-and-conditions.md)  
  (Optional GitHub Pages URL if enabled: `https://sugar-diesel.github.io/loksy-legal/terms`)

Both documents should remain publicly accessible at stable URLs during App Store review.

## How to use these links with App Store Connect

- **Privacy Policy URL:** App Store Connect → *App Information* → **Privacy Policy URL** → paste the Privacy Policy link.  
- **Support URL (optional):** You can paste a link to a landing page (e.g., GitHub Pages index) that references both documents.  
- **In-app links:** Add buttons (e.g., “Privacy Policy”, “Terms & Conditions”) that open these URLs inside the app.

## Updates

- Each document should include an **Effective date** at the top.  
- When making changes, update the Effective date and commit with a clear message (e.g., `privacy: update data retention section`).  
- Keep links stable; avoid renaming files or changing paths during app review.

## Localization

These documents are currently provided in **English only**. If you add other languages later, keep the English version available at the same URLs.
